### Hi there, I'm Jeff ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [software engineer](https://resume-jeffhappily.s3.amazonaws.com/jeff.pdf).

I focus on writing well abstracted and reliable code. I believe funtional programming and a good type system are the right tools to help achieve this. Therefore, Iâ€™m learning Haskell and looking for an opportunity to use it at work.

I also believe the [correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science)) of program. Therefore, Iâ€™m keen to explore topics like Type Theory, Proof Assistant and Formal Verification.
